To run the gallery, execute `yarn start`. This will start webpack dev server which will automatically watch the
_gallery_ files for changes.  However, it will not watch the shared components files (ie anything from outside of
this directory). So you'll also want to either run `npm run build` first, from the ../lib/ directory, or run
`npm run watch` from that directory in parallel if you want to be able to make changes to the shared components
and see the results in the gallery.
